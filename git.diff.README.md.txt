 # wtffmpeg - Natural Language to FFmpeg Translator
 
+## NOTICE, breaking change to command-line options so that they make more sense to someone comfortable in a shell.
+
+- the old `-i` behavior is now the default behavior with no arguments.
+
+This means that now, `wtff` from your command-line will put you in a REPL like a sane person would expect.
+
+- `wtff "some prompt"` will start you in a REPL, but for some reason, you wanted to type the prompt *before hitting return to get into the REPL, so you did this.
+
+I guess it's a safeer landing if you had been passing prompts at the command-line. I've seen videos of people using it like this. (Weird that I've seen videos of people using it at all tbh.) My intent when I made it was to get away from chatui, eliminate all the exposition and verbosity, and just give me the command-line, but with a safety valve of being able to review and edit commands before executing them. Which brings me to...
+
+- If you're on MacOS or Linux, Python (and your login shell too) almost certainly were compiled with libreadline. So now wtffmpeg's REPL uses readline so nobody has to be a savage, or tortured by a CLI.
+
+This means that your up/down arrows from prompt/command history should just work as you expect them to now.a Your left and right arrow too for that matter, which so long as you're in a decent terminal, should mean that you can now easily make edits to your command-line, history, etc. Which brings me to...
+
+- added ~/.wtff_history
+
+So now even between invocations of wtff, your history should be maintained across sessions. This is a good thing because if you aren't wanting to use it one command at a time with -e. -x, or --exec[ute], the expected behavior should be a REPL. Otherwise, you'd just be using a web chaat UI to your preferred LLM, reading the really long answers to how to do something with ffmpeg, and curating/copy/paste between your browser and your shell. wtffmpeg was intended to be a shell interface. 
+
+
+# WTF? ffmpeg?
+
 `wtffmpeg` is a command-line tool that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to translate plain English descriptions of video and audio tasks into executable `ffmpeg` commands. It can use local models via Ollama or other OpenAI-compatible APIs, as well as the official OpenAI API.
 
 Stop searching through Stack Overflow and documentation for that one specific `ffmpeg` flag. Just ask for what you want.

+## TODO (MAYBE):
+- add `/` commands from inside the REPL for things like `/chdir /some/new/dir` and have it change your working path wrt the REPL. (Otherwise, `!cd /some/dir` only executes within the context of the spawned shell for the subcommand, which is only useful if you are chaining commands together; doing subshell scripting and is probably not what you expect.) Maybe things like /help, or other non ffmpeg-related interactions you need to have with the REPL or LLM.
